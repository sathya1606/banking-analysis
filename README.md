⦁	The bank direct marketing data analysis is important work that helps the banks predict whether customers will sign long term deposits with the banks. The method that can predict such customers' needs can be profitable to the banks for improving their marketing campaign strategies.

⦁	Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. 

⦁	In our project, we analyzed data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called Banking - Analysis of Bank Marketing dataset.The Data is related to direct marketing  campaigns. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.Often, more than one contact with the same client was required,in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.
